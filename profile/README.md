## What's OpenLearn About? <a name="whats-openlearn-about"></a>

**OpenLearn NITJ** is *your* student-run community focused on **learning by doing**. We bridge the gap between classes and the real world by getting hands-on with technology, building cool projects, and diving into the culture of open source.

Our core idea is simple: the best way to learn is by **building together** and **sharing openly**. We create opportunities for NITJ students to:

*   Tackle practical projects and gain real skills.
*   Collaborate with peers and learn from each other.
*   Explore coding, AI/ML, web dev, and more in a supportive space.
*   Contribute to and understand the power of open source.

No boring lectures here â€“ just practical learning, real projects, and a passionate community.
