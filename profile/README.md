  *"Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower. The people in the Indian countryside don't use their intellect like we do, they use their intuition instead, and their intuition is far more developed than in the rest of the world... Intuition is a very powerful thing, more powerful than intellect, in my opinion."*
  
  **— Steve Jobs**
